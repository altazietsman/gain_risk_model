# gain_risk_model

This repository includes the gain-risk model to model stomatal conductance as well as the input dataframes used.

## Models

There are two versions of the model available: Model1.R includes hydraulic limitation and Model2.R does not include a dynamic change in hydraulic limitation. 
Both models are written as a function. Please note that functions were not written for publication.
